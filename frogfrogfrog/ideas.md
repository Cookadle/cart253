TO DRAW: background of title screen =title frogfrogfrog



scoring system
negative value ,every fly eaten is one less annoying frog in this damned world
 a fly lays up to 75 to 150 eggs so each fly is female in this game nd losing their babies spiders take time creeping up on screen as score keep going lower and lower

** Draw aserite of three eggs larvae as currency next to score IF YOU HAVE TIME

 ending
setTimeout() for a delay
 frog get fatter ,max fatness is 125
 So each time

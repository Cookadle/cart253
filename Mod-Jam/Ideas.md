# Ideas for Mod Jam 
## Frogfrogfrog

#### Title page modifications 

1.Make the title screen more fun visually
( make the frog frog frog display in a stairs pattern  or change color to maybe a gradiant green)

2.Make the click to begin an actual button that has to be clicked to start
(the big fat red button you know) which has to be clicked ( if click button is mouseclick,start game. If anything outside of that button is clicked,game will not start )since its a precision game might as well get the player to be precise already

3.Make the designated area(canvas) of the game bigger depending on the platform detected (Mobile or Web browser).
Maybe I can do like html code when i have a media fonction so that both web and mobile have different layout but applied to jsp5
(This is personel but I hate playing computer games that dont utilize at least 50% of the screen.Be bigger or don't get on my screen)

4.Add a cutesy border around canvas
Could be a fly border or a flower border anything,just make it look customized and pretty

5.CREDITS and socials etc
Its your game pippin so add your signature emoji aka the clown emoji on the screen ,somewhere in the corner and when the clown has been clicked a tab will open on pippinbar.com

#### In game modifications
1.Add a point system to keep track of score
(well its just nice to know how much bugs I have eaten so far )

2.Add a louder sound when you catch a fly (ping,ding,clink?)
(I feel like the gulp sound is not loud enough.While the fly position slighty reset ,it could take others a bit longer to catch on the fact that they are playing the game correctly)

3.Make the eyes follow the mouse cursor and not the fly
(if mouse goes 'outside the blue screen' coordinates more than 3 times ,the frog eyes get dizzy and cant get his tongue out for 4seconds (delay) + constraint of tongue element?
(So if mouse=-x,-y then +1 to a dizzy variable and if dizzy=3 then tongue constraint or delay?)

4.Make the fly go outside the blue canvas 
(Maybe draw two canvas ,one in white bigger than the blue)So when you follow it outside the blue canvas you actually get penalized by idea 3) but draw a clear border line surrounding the white canvas cause anything outside that white boarder would be idle mode

5.add visual clues for when the frog catch the fly
in case someone is mute or want to play this without any sounds.Like a big emoji of a mouth appearing on screen when eaten

6.let fly and frog fall asleep after screen idle goes over 10 minutes
maybe make them slow down after 5 minutes then 10 fall asleep maybe theres a if mouse not moving or something

7.Add a shop in game
You can trade your flies for cute little hat that will be put on the frog and fly,maybe even change skin colour like vampire frog,pumpkin frog or even change the border theme

8.Add time elements and change them over time passed PLAYING and idle mode
Maybe a little sun in corner to indicate day then slowly make it move and dissapear off screen ,then appear the moon or some stars ,some clouds or birds

9.Add an idle mode or animation (AFK)
Most game have idle mode and nothing a player like more than disrupting idle mode

10.Add special game mode
Add like a race mode where you catch as many flies as possible under 60 secs or one where you race others frogs by eating flies

#### In game modfications affected by score 

1.Add special fly
To reward the player and keep them engaged ,after 100 has been achieved as a score,add a golden fly that will pop up on screen for 20 seconds then dissapear
Set it to appear everytime score reaches 100,200,300,400,500,600,etc
so if score=10*10,10*20,10*30,10*40,draw goldenfly?
(gotta keep rewarding their progress get them addicted to the game)

2.If your cursor is not on the page (basicallly when idle mode ) then frog will follow fly 
(if mouse = mouse.y and mouse.x then eyes follow mouse x,y else follow fly?Will have to set up the mouse.y.x limitationsI I have no clue how to do it , I cannot going to lie  )

3.Add controls to be unlocked 
After reaching a certain score (100?),unlock a new control (space bar most likely) to change the orientation of the frog so when space is pressed the frog can move on top,left or rigth side and not just bottom.

4.Add time penalization for hardcore gamers
Once you reach 300 points ,if you havent managed to catch a fly under 8-10 secs you lose two points

5.let fly go  behind frod and all over canvas after score 85 reaches
Since we want to keep the player intrigued let him exprience frustation as the fly seems out of his reach every so often

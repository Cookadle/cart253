# Frog Fest

## [Lanna Check](https://lannacheck-ops.github.io/cart253/mod-jam/frogfrogfrog/)

I think the tutorial is very cool, very well implemented. Made the game mechanics quite clear for someone who doesn't have access to Lanna [Github](https://github.com/lannacheck-ops/cart253/tree/main/mod-jam/frogfrogfrog).  I like how the frog and his other body parts were part of the experience as well. As you get hungrier and hungrier the tongue length  get  shorten which also signal the player they have to get better or die. The eyes of the frog follow the mouse cursor from left to right and as your health get worse the icon of the frog get  sadder.I love how creative this part was. Beyond that, I think Lanna game is perfect in the way that all the functions demanded were implemented correctly while also making this project her own.

The only improvements I would add

This is more of a personal matter, but I think if music is to be implemented to also have a mute button. Not everyone enjoy the same music, and adding a mute button would ensure the user can still enjoy the game without being turned off by the music.

Also, once the tutorial is over, the instructions loop over and over. I understand the escape button was added for this effect, but I think making the tutorial lead to the game or main screen by itself once it's done explaining would have been cool

This [“frog” game](https://github.com/kaim-bit/cart253/tree/main/topics/Mod-Jam/frogfrogfrog) was not what I expected at all, there's not even a frog anymore but a canon instead, which is a unique concept  I have not seen in this class. To have the canon ball bounce back down the screen instead of just making it disappear when it goes upwards is also a cool detail. It  doesn't change much to the game, but it strangely satisfies me as a player/viewer. The backstory in the instructions was a great idea, I  actually got excited to try the game  after reading it.

As I identify as an artist (my opinion could be bias) before I identify as a  programmer, I do have to say the lack of “art” does make steer away from the game after 2/3 tries. Not to say art isn't present, but it feels a bit flat. I thought maybe the game over screen would be a bit pushed like the instructions screen but was greeted with a dark blue screen who would just bring me back to the menu

While the menu is not what you would typically find for starting screen, I do find it a bit frustrating to have to hover over a moving square to get to the game as well.


## [Kerven](https://yatsukki.github.io/cart253/topic/events/flying-frogs/)
Really cool art  style, for me what left a deep impression was the art style, not the gameplay. As I know Kerven and his love  for  rage bait,  I  will not comment on the [gameplay](https://github.com/yatsukki/cart253/tree/main/topic/events/flying-frogs) main goal. He implemented the buttons very well, it's cool that they actually push down when you hover over them, beautiful title screen as well, the floating title, the moving clouds, all in all beautiful creative work *chef's kiss*. You can see Kerven skill, as a graphic designer,  truly shine here.

I  won't be tricked to be mad BUT as Kerven tries to [rage bait](https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/rage-bait) you with his hardcore game mechanic, I have found a way to avoid the flies without having to move much. By staying at the top of the screen and staying in the corner I have managed to stay alive for 42 seconds, which isn't much but not a lot of effort was created to afford this 42 second of survival. I think, working on the fly system so that the wave  are able to reach the top and bottom of the screen more often or make the fly have different starting point would make it even more challenging.

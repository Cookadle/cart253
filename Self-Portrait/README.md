## Description


This is a self portrait of Jeany Corrius one of the many formidable students of Pippin.Not meant to be accurate,it was heavily inspired by Picasso and his cubism style.This self portrait

has for goal to merge the windows 7 with cubism art as a fun nostalgic way to present myself.Ideally the user should feel as if they wwere pulled back in the early 2000s.
